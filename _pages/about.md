Hello there! I'm Zhuang Qiu, but you can call me "Harvey". It's a name that's been keeping me company for a good while now. <br style="clear: both;" />

I hold a Ph.D. in Linguistics and an M.A. in Psychology from the University of California, Davis. My academic journey through doctoral studies was guided by the remarkable committee of Prof. [Fernanda Ferreira](https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/people/fferreir), Prof. [Emily Morgan](https://linguistics.ucdavis.edu/people/emily-morgan), and Prof. [Kenji Sagae](https://compling.ucdavis.edu/sagae/), together with an incredible group of researchers.

My Postdoc Journey
======
Currently, I'm immersed in the vibrant postdoctoral life at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Collaborating closely with  Prof. [Cai Zhenguang](https://cuhklpl.github.io/people.html), I'm delving into the captivating realm of psycholinguistic research. Our exploration centers around understanding the predictive mechanisms that drive sentence comprehension and unraveling the intricate web of knowledge representation within large language models.

My journey in research has always been anchored in a fascination with the cognitive dimensions of human language. I've directed my focus towards unraveling the mental blueprints that underlie words and sentences, as well as the fundamental mechanisms that underpin the art of conveying meaning. This exploration takes shape through a diverse range of methodologies, from eye-tracking and priming to corpus studies and the dynamic world of machine learning. These endeavors underscore the pivotal roles of meticulous experimental design and comprehensive statistical modeling in untangling the intricate patterns woven within the fabric of language comprehension.

Off the Clock
======
When I'm not diving into research, you'll find me strumming tunes, sweating it out at the gym, or on the ultimate foodie adventure across Hong Kong. Whether conquering peaks during a hike or embracing culinary exploration, I'm all in. However, living in Hong Kong means my kitchen is cozier than I'd like for whipping up new recipes. As a result, I've temporarily traded my chef's hat for a journal, using my leisure time to chronicle experiences rather than culinary experiments.
