In my role as a teaching assistant for <i>Introduction to Psycholinguistics, </i> I designed interactive discussion seminars, offering students a platform to engage with the course material. I provided guidance and support during office hours, addressing their inquiries and concerns. Furthermore, I meticulously evaluated assignments and exams, contributing to the assessment process and the overall success of the course.
