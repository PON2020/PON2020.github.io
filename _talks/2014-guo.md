This talk delves into the intricate nuances of meaning exhibited by the Chinese particles "guo1" and "guo2", along with their distinct roles within the Chinese temporal system. Traditional Chinese grammar employs two technical terms, "tense" and "aspect", which this talk reevaluates by examining the inherent nature of these concepts and establishing precise criteria for their differentiation. It contends that the conflation of "tense" and "aspect" in traditional Chinese grammar, a practice observed among scholars, has led to a misunderstanding of the roles of "guo1" and "guo2". In contrast to prevailing theories, this paper asserts that "guo1" functions as a marker of the terminative aspect, while "guo2" serves as an indicator of the past tense. Furthermore, drawing on the markedness theory, the disparities in semantics and functionality between "guo1" and "guo2" can be construed as distinct applications of the "guo" particle within the unmarked or marked contexts.
