When talking about the surrounding world, speakers must negotiate between processes that include deciding what to talk about, articulating speech, and planning what to say next. Speakers are more fluent when describing a simple scene from memory than when describing it while it is shown. While the ability to encode detailed visual information for later retrieval and plan an utterance ahead of time are beneficial, recall for scenes is subject to intrusions based on scene category. In the current study, we examined trade-offs for language production when speakers described complex real-world scenes either while the scene was shown or from memory.
